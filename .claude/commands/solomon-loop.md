You are the orchestrator for the solomon delivery lifecycle. Read
`docs/solomon-workflow.md` first. Your job: scan where work stopped, then propose
— and, on the user's confirmation, run — the single best next `/solomon-*`
workflow. `$ARGUMENTS` may narrow the focus to a specific issue or PR.

## 1. Scan the current state

Gather these and summarize them concisely:

- `mcp__solomon-memory__get_latest_activity` — the last recorded session or handoff (where the team stopped). If it returns a handoff with a `contract_path`, read that handoff contract first and treat it as the bounded input — open the artifacts it points to (PLAN.md, the diff, the ADR, the PR) only when you need them, instead of re-deriving prior context.
- `mcp__solomon-memory__get_open_issues` and `gh issue list --state open` — open work and its labels.
- `gh pr list --state open` — pull requests and their review/approval state.
- The board columns (Ready / In Progress / In Review) via `gh project item-list` or `solomon_harness.github`.

## 2. Decide the next step (first match wins)

1. A pull request that is **approved** → `/solomon-release <pr>`.
2. A pull request **open and awaiting review** → `/solomon-review <pr>`.
3. An issue **In Progress** with a branch but no PR yet → resume with `/solomon-start <issue>` (continue the TDD loop and open the PR).
4. A **Ready** issue (refined, Definition of Ready met) → `/solomon-start <issue>`.
5. A **Backlog** issue not yet refined → `/solomon-refine <issue>`.
6. An **Idea** worth promoting → `/solomon-issue` (or `/solomon-refine`).
7. **Nothing in progress and the backlog is empty** → there is no work to advance; ask the user whether to create one — `/solomon-idea`, `/solomon-issue`, or `/solomon-bug` — and what it is about.

If `$ARGUMENTS` names a specific issue or PR, evaluate that item and pick its next step.

## 3. Propose, confirm, run

- Tell the user, in two to four lines: where things stopped, what is in flight, and the single recommended next step (the exact `/solomon-*` command and its target).
- Wait for confirmation. Outward-facing actions (creating issues or PRs, merging, releasing) always require an explicit go-ahead.
- On confirmation, run that workflow by following its command file `.claude/commands/solomon-<stage>.md` and delegating to its driving agents. Advance one stage per invocation; re-run `/solomon-loop` to continue.

## 4. Record

- `mcp__solomon-memory__save_decision` — the loop's recommendation and the chosen action, so the next session resumes from it.
- `mcp__solomon-memory__log_handoff` — when the chosen workflow hands off to the next stage.

Never advance more than one stage without checking in. The loop proposes; the user decides.
